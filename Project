To submit the URL of the repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub (or the platform where your repository is hosted).
2. Copy the URL from the address bar of your browser.
3. Paste the URL into the submission form or the required field for submission.

For example, the URL might look like this:
```
https://github.com/username/repository-name
```

If you provide me with more context or specific instructions for the platform or course you are using, I can offer more tailored guidance.
